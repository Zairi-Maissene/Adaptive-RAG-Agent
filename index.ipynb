        "\n",
        "In this project, we implement a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent** powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). The agent is designed to handle user queries by combining information retrieval from a **ChromaDB vector database** and performing **real-time web searches** when the data isn't available in the local knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, the agent handles:\n",
        "- Queries related to **INSAT (Institut National des Sciences Appliquées et de Technologie)** and other **computer science universities in Tunisia** by fetching data from a pre-built vector database (ChromaDB).\n",
        "- Queries that are out of scope for the vector database by performing a **live web search**.\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure accuracy and reduce hallucinations (incorrect or fabricated information generated by the LLM), we also have a graph node that checks for that behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "The routing between the vector database and web search is managed by **LangGraph**, which defines the decision logic based on the nature of the query. Additionally, **LangGraph** is utilized to monitor and control hallucinations by creating a graph node that checks the factual consistency of responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "This solution integrates multiple cutting-edge tools and technologies to create an efficient and intelligent question-answering system that balances retrieval from both **structured** (ChromaDB) and **unstructured** (web search) data sources.\n"
